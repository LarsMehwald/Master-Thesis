# Master-Thesis
This is a repository that contains a version of my master thesis. 
The thesis was submitted in 2016 at the Hertie School. Hence the code and the data available at the respective APIs created this fully reprodicible workflow. Rerunning the code could lead to deviating results, due to changing data and other packages (the version of the packages used for this thesis are cited in the bibliography). 
I wrote this master thesis without using GitHub, hence no project history is available.
